# Junior Design Project 2

## Bop-It Slot Machine Design

  There are three unique inputs for users to play. The first is inserting a coin into a slot with an IR sensor to detect motion through the slot. The second input will be a lever acting as a switch on the side of the enclosure. The third input will request that users spin the slots - there will be 3 wheels on an axle on the front of the enclosure, and the axle will be connected to a rotary encoder that detects the spin. The system outputs to determine which task to complete are as follows: 1 beep = insert coin, 2 beeps = pull the lever, 3 beeps = spin the slots.

  There will be a power switch on top of the enclosure and start/reset push button on the front of the enclosure. Two 7-segment displays will show the score, increasing by 1 for every correct input action completed in the allotted amount of time. If a mistake is made, a red LED will flash and the display will show the final score for 3 seconds before returning to default.
